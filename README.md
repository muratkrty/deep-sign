-------------------
Off-line singature image classification via Convolutional Neural Networks.
The signature images were obtained from GDPS database trough licence agreement.
The GPDS signature image database contains 4000 synthetic signature owners and
the database consists of 24 genuine signatures and 30 faked signatures images
for each signature owner. The images in 600 dots per in resolution (dpi) and in
